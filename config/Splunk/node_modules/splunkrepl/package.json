Your results will get returned.\n\n### Non-Interactive\n* Run \"splunkrepl\" at the terminal, passing in required params of `--host`, `--user` and `--pwd` and also passing `--query`\n\n### Options\n\nArgument  | Required | Description\n--------  | -------- | -----------------\n--host    | X        | Splunk host to connect to including the port, ex. \"https://localhost:8089\"               \n--user    | X        | Splunk user to connect with                                                              \n--pwd     | X        | Password for the Splunk Account                                                          \n--query   |          | SPL query to immediately execute. Runs in non-interactive mode                           \n--verbose |          | Return as much detail as possible within each event (see below)                                       \n\n## Verbose mode\nBy default when queries run, splunkrepl will return only _time, source, sourcetype, host and _raw (if available) fields. To get all the details specify `--verbose` and you will get output similar to below:\n\n![ScreenShot](https://raw.github.com/glennblock/splunkrepl/screenshots/verbose.png)\n\n## License\nApache 2\n",
